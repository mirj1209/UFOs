# UFOs
## Overview
The purpose of this project is to create a dynamic table while being able to filter mutliple criteria at the same time.

## Results
When opening the html file, you'll be led to a website with a huge unfiltered table and various spaces for you to input the desired requirements for the data on the side that'll be labeled as "Filter Search". You can input the desired requirements and press enter, the table should filter itself immediately to your desired requirements. 

## Summary
One drawback of this webpage, is that it's a single page so every single piece of data is at your face instead of having different hyperlinked branches in order to actually navigate the webpage.

### Recomendations
1. Since the "Filter Search" will only accept an exact find, it would be a good idea to set up a function or for loop to erase extra spacing and include capital letters for example whenever you'd like to search for the city Benton. 

2. TBD
